# Smart Digital Lock System Using VHDL

## Overview
This project implements a smart digital lock system coded in VHDL for FPGA deployment. It simulates a secure keypad-based lock with features including:

- Keypad interface with debounce logic
- 7-segment display status indicators
- Lock state machine controlling locked, unlocked, and alert states
- Wrong attempt detection and alert system
- Master reset functionality

The design is targeted for implementation on FPGA development boards such as Xilinx Spartan and has been fully simulated using ModelSim.

## Features
- **Keypad Input**: Accurate keypad scanning and debounce
- **State Machine Control**: Robust lock/unlock logic handling
- **7-Segment Display Interface**: Displays lock status and attempts count
- **Security Alerts**: Wrong password attempt alerts with counter
- **Master Reset**: Allows system reset to initial state

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the VHDL source files in your FPGA IDE or simulation tool.
3. Simulate the system with ModelSim or Vivado simulator.
4. Synthesize and deploy on your FPGA board.
5. Connect a 4x4 keypad and 7-segment display to interact with the lock.
